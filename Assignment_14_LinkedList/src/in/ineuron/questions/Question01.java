ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

	Given a linked list ofÂ **N**Â nodes such that it may contain a loop.
	A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to 
	the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.
	Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which 
	is forming the loop.
	
	Example 1:
	Input:
	N = 3
	value[] = {1,3,4}
	X = 2
	Output:1
	Explanation:The link list looks like
	1 -> 3 -> 4
     	 ^    |
         |____|
	A loop is present. If you remove it
	successfully, the answer will be 1.
	
	Example 2:
	Input:
	N = 4
	value[] = {1,8,3,4}
	X = 0
	Output:1
	Explanation:TheÂ Linked list does not
	contains any loop.
	
	Example 3:
	Input:
	N = 4
	value[] = {1,2,3,4}
	X = 1
	Output:1
	Explanation:The link list looks like
	1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
	^              |
	|______________|
	A loop is present.
	If you remove it successfully,
	the answer will be 1.
